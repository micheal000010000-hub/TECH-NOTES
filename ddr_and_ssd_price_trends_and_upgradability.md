# DDR4 / DDR5 and SSD price trends and hardware upgradability

**Date:** 17 December 2025

## Observation
In recent months, prices for system memory (DDR4, DDR5) and SSDs have
shown noticeable volatility, with several reports indicating sharp
short-term increases after a period of sustained decline.

## Contributing factors
Commonly cited reasons for rising prices include:
- Production adjustments by memory manufacturers
- Supply-side consolidation
- Increased demand from AI, data center, and OEM segments
- Reduced inventory compared to previous oversupply cycles

These factors tend to affect both DDR memory and NAND-based storage.

## Implications for end users and developers
Rising component prices directly impact:
- Laptop and desktop base configurations
- Upgrade costs over the system’s lifetime
- Total cost of ownership for development machines

Systems with non-upgradable memory or storage amplify this risk, as
future upgrades may be impossible or significantly more expensive.

## Upgradability as a risk-mitigation strategy
Laptops that provide:
- User-accessible RAM slots
- Standard M.2 SSD expansion

offer flexibility against market volatility by allowing upgrades to be
deferred or performed when pricing is more favorable.

## Practical takeaway
When selecting development hardware, upgradability can be as important
as initial specifications, especially during periods of component price
instability.
